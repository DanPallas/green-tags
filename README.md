green-tags
==========

Audio tagging library for Clojure

The goal of this library is provide functionality for getting and setting tags from mp3, mp4/m4a, ogg, and flac files
in a simple, clojure-friendly way that smooths over all the differences between the different tag types.
green-tags is currently in alpha and only supports reading of standard tags. I'm actively working on expanding
functionalityl.
